# Web3 Developer Portfolio

This repository contains a Web3 Developer Portfolio showcasing my experience and skills with decentralized technologies. The portfolio includes details on tools and platforms I use, such as Ethereum, Solidity, IPFS, and other Web3 protocols.

## Technologies Used

- **Ethereum**: The blockchain platform I use for building decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts.
- **Solidity**: The primary language for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum network.
- **IPFS**: Decentralized file storage used to store data in a peer-to-peer network.
- **Web3.js**: A JavaScript library to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Metamask**: Cryptocurrency wallet that interacts with Ethereum and other blockchains.
